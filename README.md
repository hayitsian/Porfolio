# Portfolio
A collection of some of my completed projects

# Table of contents:

1. C
    1. Malloc
        1. A project I worked on as an undergraudate taking Computer Systems, we were 
           assigned to write our own malloc() function in C, and test it for both single 
           thread and multithread performance across several systems and compare it to
           Linux's own malloc().
1. MATLAB
    1. EField Simulation
        1. A small project I worked on as a freshman under Professor Carey Rappaport at 
           Northeastern University, looking to analyze if microwaves would increase the 
           accuracy and precision of mammograms in addition to xrays. This code will simulate
           a microwave passing through Low Water Content (LWC) tissue to represent fatty tissue,
           and a selected number of High Water Content (HWC) points that represent tumors.
1. Java
    1. Traveling Salesman
        1. My first project, completed in high school for our senior capstone project, was
           seeking to analyze if traveling salesman algorithms could be used to improve the
           efficiency of class scheduling to reduce hallway traffic in our crowded school.
           While the code is rather rudimentary, the project is sentimental to me as it
           was my introduction to coding and led me to study it in college.
